# Agent-Based Artificial Intelligence Course Codes

This repository contains code developed during the **Agent-Based Artificial Intelligence** course, organized into modules covering various AI techniques, algorithms, and problem-solving strategies. Each module is structured to focus on specific areas of agent-based systems and related search methodologies.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into four main modules:

- **Main**: Contains the main scripts for each problem addressed in the course, serving as entry points to test and run the different algorithms and simulations.

- **Search**: Includes implementations of search algorithms used in game theory and adversarial settings, such as `Minimax`, `Limited Minimax`, `AlphaBeta Pruning`, and `Limited AlphaBeta Pruning`.

- **Games**: Dedicated to game-based simulations, this module includes classes for defining `Player` behaviors and strategies relevant to agent-based games.

- **Csp (Constraint Satisfaction Problems)**: Focuses on CSP-related algorithms and problem-solving approaches, including `AC3`, `Backtracking`, `Constraints`, and specific `Problems`.
